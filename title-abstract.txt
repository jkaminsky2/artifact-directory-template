Title:
BlockX: A Secure, Decentralized Data and Code Marketplace

Abstract:
The world of data analytics and blockchain technology is rapidly evolving, with the global blockchain market projected to reach $163.83 billion by 2029 and the data analytics market expected to hit $329.8 billion by 2030. With data being referred to as “the new oil,” cyberattacks against local and cloud storage have reached new heights that surmounted to $530 million in reported losses in 2023 alone; this necessitates a new data and code storage method, one where data can be encrypted, securely stored, and easily accessible, all while being able to handle the increasing amount of data being stored.

A decentralized, secure data marketplace on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) meets these key requirements: it can securely–and optimally–store large amounts of data on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) using encryption techniques, on top of allowing seamless data-related transactions within minutes. Prior research attempted to instantiate this, but these versions neglected to account for potentially dangerous datasets, the exclusion of non-consensual personal identifiable information (PII), and trustless integration of analytical capabilities that allow for secure, transparent data exchanges without compromising privacy.
    
To address this issue, we implemented BlockX: a decentralized data marketplace on the EVM with IPFS storage–optimized via encryption and verified with dangerous data and PII checks. This decentralized application is a safe and secure data ecosystem that aids the advancement of artificial intelligence and helps businesses and individuals with their data needs.
